I'm an AI researcher at NVIDIA, currently focusing the reliability and efficiency of agentic systems. I was previously at Meta, ETH Zurich, and the University of Oxford. My past work revolved arond efficiency of deep learning models, and the interface of the continuous and the discrete in deep learning, and agent-based financial modelling.

I'm active in professional service: please address reviewing/PC/talk requests at my email. I'm open to collaborations on position, opionion, and survey papers.
